(requirements: Maven and Leiningen)

## Generating java library and installing in local maven repo



```
$ cd ew_snmp
$ lein clean
$ lein install
```

### Testing library from eclipse project (java code)

** Prior to test you'll need a login.properties file** in this directory `./open-stack-wrapper-test/src/test/java/test/login.properties`

With these properties:
```
username=your-openstack-username
password=your-openstack-password
url=your-openstack-login-entrypoint(horizon)-include-port ex: http://8.21.28.222:5000

```


### Or, directly from eclipse: ....   
1. create new java project using specific location (locate dir "open-stack-wrapper-test")   
2. enable maven nature if eclipse doesn't automatically recognize It   
3. locate OpenStackTest and run as JUnit test
